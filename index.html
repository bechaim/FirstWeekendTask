                    requires some primary education in order to understand and be understood. Beyond that, writing in a
                    comprehensive way requires a complete high-school education, and even academy-level education.

                    What people do while they speak often says more than the actual words. Non-verbal communication
                    includes facial expressions, posture, eye contact, hand movements, and touch.

                    Non-Verbal Communication can manifest in many ways, some by our face while others include hand
                    movement or even entire body movement. Many of these are involuntary and may show our true feelings
                    about the situation or conversation.

                    are running 24/7, Facebook is visual with memes, videos, images, etc., Instagram is an image-only
                    platform, and advertisers use imagery to sell products and ideas.

                    Listening is the most important aspect of communication.<br>
                    It is key to all effective communication. Without the ability to listen effectively, messages are
                    easily misunderstood. As a result, communication breaks down and the sender of the message can
                    easily become frustrated or irritated.<br>
                    Effective listening is a skill that underpins all positive human relationships.
