  I've enjoyed this task very much, mostly using CSS. I believe I have improved greatly throughout this week,
  and one thing I've learned by doing this project is that @media query is an important element in CSS that I should master,
  or that I should have multiple queries in the future in order to support as many devices as I believe my website will reach.
  In this project I've put my @media query last since it interfered with the rest of my CSS code.
